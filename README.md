### "Tune In"
![](https://i.imgur.com/UX9qUNc.png)
<p>"Tune In" - 2019, Acrylic on Wood Panel 24"x24". Original and 20 prints sold out. NFTs were sold as a pair with the print. “Tune In” depicts a woman gazing confidently with the Ethereum logo painted on her face. She represents the readiness of our ecosystem to go forth and build the future of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) & virtual worlds. This piece acts as a timestamp for the NFT ecosystem in early 2019. In the background, we see CryptoPunks, Cryptovoxels, CryptoKitties, Chain Breakers, Autoglyphs, Neon District, Plasma Bears, and Decentraland. Have you tuned in?</p>

### "Eartha"
![](https://i.imgur.com/dzl1uE2.png)
<p>Earth’s progenitor and nurturer, Eartha inhabits the timeless dimension where she continuously gestates a new Earth which, through her tears, she populates with primates made in her image. Sad tears these are as over and over she goes through this rebirth process in the knowledge that this new Earth too will perish in the hands of the very creatures she grants life to ad aeternum.I’ve hand sculpted this character in Virtual Reality, then created the scene, animated and filmed it synchronized to the soundtrack. Cinematic Immersive VR Art by Spaced Painter. Soundtrack “Quartz Emerald” by Extra Terra. Specs: 60 fps mp4 3840 x 2160 res (4K)</p>

### Uroboros Twins
![](https://i.imgur.com/TuPswNJ.png)
<p>Take a glimpse, fellow human, into the unfathomable cosmic dance of the adversarial twin gods through whom climax planets are born. They are Yin and Yang in perfect symbiosis. The cosmic Ouroborus pair who wrestles their phalluses into explosive creation.I’ve hand sculpted these characters in Virtual Reality, then created the scene, animated and filmed it synchronized to the soundtrack. Cinematic Immersive VR Art by Spaced Painter. Soundtrack “Tribal Waves” by Extra Terra. Specs: 60 fps mp4 3840 x 2160 res (4K)</p>

### **By Which The Sun Was Nibbled On**
![](https://i.imgur.com/qUKuv7c.png)
<p>This obscure Trickster god dwells at the edge of good and bad, right and wrong, male and female. A mischievous jester archetype in charge of protecting the Cosmic Egg while juggling planets as well as their own impulses (dark and light) like the time this joker secretly broke the Egg and drank of the sunshine in an attempt to illuminate their eyes and soul. I’ve hand sculpted this character in Virtual Reality, then created the scene, animated and filmed it synchronized to the soundtrack. Cinematic Immersive VR Art by Spaced Painter. Soundtrack “Blockchain” by Extra Terra. Specs: 60 fps mp4 3840 x 2160 res (4K)</p>

### **Origin SPECTR**
![](https://i.imgur.com/Xea6E17.png)
<p>This is a new digital imagining of the original Spectr character I turned into a resin toy when I began using this artist name around 2012. This crazy individual grew out of an automatic-drawing session, a technique I still use to this day if I want to generate warped and fractured looking characters. I have fond memories of buying resin and silicone in bulk for the first time and pouring a limited run of these guys out in a grungy old garden shed. The resin toy comprised of 5 separate moulds, not the easiest design to begin with, but I like to challenge myself. Now one collector can own this tasty slice of digital 3D character Art. Due to the limit on upload size here, I will also provide the collector with a maximum resolution copy of the model in addition to the token if or when they request it.</p>

### **Toby Spikes - Down In The Pond series**
![](https://i.imgur.com/nZhCGRC.png)

<p>This is one of many plankton and sea-life inspired characters I created recently while developing a story that takes place in a tide pool. I imagine Toby living in a surreal little aquatic fantasy world, and now I’m sending him off to swim the blockchain seas, I’m sure he’ll be fine, he has some decent spikes and powerful flippers on him, plus 5 eyes can't be bad! Hand sculpted and painted in Oculus Medium. Due to the limit on upload size here, I can provide the collector with a maximum resolution file of the model in addition to this token if they wish to request it.</p>

![](https://i.imgur.com/7Bbuj0V.jpg)  

<p>A statue for the Metaverse; a warning to all those who enter that we must avoid allowing the gatekeepers, middlemen and overseers of the old world mediate our experience of this new digital frontier. Hand modelled entirely in virtual reality using Gravity Sketch on Oculus Quest 2. Bespoke doom soundtrack written by Cosmognostic. Drums performed / recording engineered by John Simm.</p>

### **Coveted Constructs**
![](https://i.imgur.com/2lypHDn.jpg)

<p>Audio/Visual Collaboration with Music Artist Anjulie. 'For all those that stand before the Coveted Constructs they are often struck with varying manners of emotion. Awe, empowerment, delight, shock or even lust. (Depending on who you speak to) The Constructs are providers, forever self-sustaining and givers of life to its surrounding dwellings. Yet, despite its marvels the constructs are bizarrely covered from certain visitors to not draw attention to itself. Often imposed by the apparent judiciaries of the constructs who supposedly govern how they should operate.'</p>

### **The Original Oculus**
![](https://i.imgur.com/5W4tPWL.jpg)

<p>A biomechanical marvel an treasure of the Artist and Creator. For over a thousand years it was once thought that the Eyes functioned in similar ways to a torch, emanating beams of light out at the world and illuminating the objects we looked at. It was only through further dissection around the 17th Century that we realised that imagery captured by the lens of the eye was rendered upside down with our brains doing the heavy lifting of translating sensory information.</p>

### **The S.V Squawker is now boarding**
![](https://i.imgur.com/r0AjVBL.jpg)

<p>‘In the age of Abundance, society’s elite take long luxurious cruises into the skies to escape the problems of the world. Ships crafted and fashioned after creatures long since extinct perform rituals of maintenance before setting off into the clouds. As guests stare in awe of the progress of their cityscapes and technological marvels, none of them have actually seen real birds before. That's simply ridiculous.' Selenus Mortimer - Age of Abundance. </p>

### **The Great Room**
![](https://i.imgur.com/imjcfBR.jpg)

<p>There are bits of information invisibly flowing all around us in ever increasing rates. Considering that 90% of the world's information was generated in the past 2 years, our world has become completely submerged within a digital reality.

The Internet Archive is a modern day Library of Alexandria with a mission to provide Universal Access to All Knowledge. Within this former church, the servers behind these walls currently store over 330 billion web pages, 20 million books and texts, 200,000 software programs, 4.5 million audio recordings, and much more.

Since 2015 the Internet Archive has called for a distributed web and has been experimenting with systems like IPFS for its own systems. Within this Great Room the original architects of the web like Vint Cerf and Tim Berners Lee along with the next generation have gathered to discuss technologies of the decentralized web and how we can build it together.</p>

### **The Archives**
![](https://i.imgur.com/B44jzo5.jpg)

<p>The web is an ephemeral media, always growing in size, and stuck in a constant state of rot. Even as nature has slowly overtaken the church, a faint hum can still be heard coming from the machines.

As our society became more digital, the archives have played an increasingly important role in preserving our culture and all knowledge into the ultimate library and allowing universal access. Perhaps by delivering on this ambitious mission the Internet Archive could be considered by future generations as one of the great Wonders of the World.</p>

### **The Golden Era**
![](https://i.imgur.com/UPYi1mz.jpg)

<p>Are we living during the Golden Age of the Internet or has it already come to pass? Time moves in one direction, memory another.

Artifacts have played an important role throughout history for societies to preserve their culture and heritage. Without them, civilization has no memory or mechanism to learn from its successes and failures. Much of the cultural artifacts of the past 20 years are produced in digital form. The Internet Archive is the amber of the information age.

The Archive's vision is to build a version 2 Library of Alexandria and provide Universal Access to All Knowledge. Within this former church, the servers behind these walls serve millions of people each day with access to over 330 billion web pages, 20 million books and texts, 200,000 software programs, 4.5 million audio recordings, and much more.</p>
